# Bookstore

A React Native application for browsing and managing a collection of books.

This project demonstrates fetching data from a mock API, displaying it in a user-friendly interface, and implementing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

## Key Features

* **Browse Books:** View a list of available books.
* **View Book Details:** See detailed information for each book.
* **Add New Books:** Add books to the collection.
* **Edit Existing Books:** Modify the details of existing books.
* **Delete Books:** Remove books from the collection.
* **Utilizes a Mock API:** Demonstrates API interaction without relying on a live backend.

## Technologies Used

* React Native
* Axios (for HTTP requests)

## Project Structure

The project structure includes:

* `components/`: Reusable UI components such as `BookCard`, `CustomTextInput`.
* `screens/`: Application screens like the home screen.
* `api/`: Functions for interacting with the mock API.
